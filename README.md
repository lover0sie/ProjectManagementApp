# ProjectManagementApp

This is a simple Project Management App built with PyQt5 for my Python Programming Assignment. The aim of the app is to serve as the native application. I have used Spyder as IDE and mySQL as the database. The Project Management App consists of:

1) Welcome page
2) Sign up page
3) Log in page
4) Main menu page (displays all the projects with Project Name, Company Name, Start Date, End Date, Actual Cost, and Status and options to create, update, and delete project and meetings)
5) Create project page
6) Update project page
7) Delete project page
8) Setup Meeting page

In order to run the program successfully:

1) Open the "main2.py" in any Python IDE
2) Make sure that you add the folder to path and retrieve the ".ui" files 
3) Make sure that you have installed mySQL in your computer

Side note: The pictures might not be uploaded due to the different paths of the pictures in the ".ui" files. Make sure you download the pictures with ".png" and ".ico" files and open Qt Designer to insert the image. These images are from Canva and desktop icon websites. These images does not interfere with the functionality of the program. You can insert your own images.
